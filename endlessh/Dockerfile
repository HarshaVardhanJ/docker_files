      description="This Dockerfile creates an image containing the executable `endlessh` which is an SSH tarpit \
      that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days \
      at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies get \
      stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server." \
