#                                                                   #
# This Dockerfile does the following:                               #
#                                                                   #
#    1. Starts with a pinned-version of Golang Alpine for the       # 
#       first stage of the build.                                   #
#    2. Updates package repository information.                     #
#    3. Installs packages necessary for building 'pwndrop'.         # 
#    5. Downloads a pinned-version of the release of 'pwndrop' and  #
#       extracts the tar ball.                                      #
#    6. Changes the 'go build' command in the 'build.sh' file and   #
#       Makefile in order to build for different architectures.     #
#    6. Builds the binary from the source code.                     #
#    7. Starts with a Busybox for the final stage.                  #
#    8. Copies the necessary files from the first stage.            #
#    9. Updates the PATH variable to include the path under which   #
#       'pwndrop' is present.                                       # 
#   10. Sets the ports to be exposed.                               #
#   11. Sets the volume where data for 'pwndrop' will be stored.    #
#   12. Starts the 'pwndrop' executable as the main command.        #
#   13. Sets the arguments to the 'pwndrop' executable.             #
#                                                                   #
# Note : Do not forget to bind-mount a directory to the container   #
#        at the path declared by the VOLUME directive. This is      #
#        where the data will be stored.                             #
#        Also, do not forget to expose ports on the host machine    #
#        on which 'pwndrop' listens(port 53, 80, 443).              #
#                                                                   #
#        One line each in the build script and Makefile are being   #
#        modified in order to build the Go code for different       #
#        architectures rather than the default 'amd64'. Now,        #
#        making use of the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables,   #
#        the Go binary can be built for different platforms without #
#        having to hard-code the value in the build script.         #
#                                                                   #
#        When the image is being built using 'buildx', some         #
#        variables are made available, such as TARGETOS and         #
#        TARGETPLATFORM. These can be set as environment variables  #
#        and be used to build the Go binary for that specific       #
#        platform and architecture.                                 #
#                                                                   #
