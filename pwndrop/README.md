### NOTE:

Apart from the aforementioned images, there are other images that contain `untested` as part of their tag. **Do not use these images.** As the tag suggests, they are present for purposes of testing. In order to test the images with `container-structure-test` and `trivy`, the image needs to be present in a public repository. Therefore, I first build and push the images with an `untested` tag. Then, I run tests on these images. When the image passes all tests, it is built again and pushed with the appropriate tags.

# Software Packages Installed

The container image does not contain any other software packages installed except for the ones that come with the base image that it is built on, and the `pwndrop` executable.

The `nonroot` variant contains `libpcap` installed in order to allow the non-root user to bind to privileged ports.

The `scratch`, `busybox`, and `alpine` images do not contain any extra packages installed.



# Supported Architectures

Given below is a list of architectures for which Gitea has been built. In the near future, more architectures will be added.

* `amd64`
* `arm64`
* `arm32v6`
* `ppc64le`
* `s390x`
* `i386`



# Description of tags

### `latest`, `alpine`, `alpine-1.0.0`, `alpine-latest`, `stable` ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/latest) ![MicroBadger Layers (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/latest) 

The images with this tag are built on top of Alpine Linux. There are no additional packages installed over the base Alpine image except for the `pwndrop` executable. To use this image,  use the `alpine` tag as follows:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:alpine
```



### `busybox`, `busybox-1.0.0`, `busybox-latest` ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/busybox) ![MicroBadger Layers (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/busybox)

The images with this tag are built on top of Busybox. Similiar to the `alpine` tag, this image does not contain any other additional packages other the `pwndrop` executable. This image is smaller in size when compared to the `alpine` image. To use this image, use the `busybox` tag as follows:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:busybox
```



### `scratch`, `scratch-1.0.0`, `scratch-latest` ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/scratch) ![MicroBadger Layers (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/scratch) 

The images with this tag are built on top of Scratch(essentially, a blank slate). It goes without saying that no other packages can be installed on this. Only the `pwndrop` executable exists in this image. Since the image is built on scratch, this image is the smallest in size(a little over 6 MB). If you’re looking for the image with the smallest storage footprint, this is the one. To use this image, use the `scratch` tag as follows:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:scratch
```



### `nonroot`, `nonroot-1.0.0`  ![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/nonroot)  ![MicroBadger Layers (tag)](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/harshavardhanj/pwndrop/nonroot) 

The image with this tag, as the name states, is built with security in mind. The ‘run-as’ user in the container is a non-root user. The `pwndrop` process is also started by this user. If you prefer running containers which run processes as non-root users, this is the image for you. To use this image, use the `nonroot` tag as follows:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:nonroot
```





# How to use this image

## Start a `pwndrop` instance


A basic instance can be set up with the following one-liner command

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:latest
```

This will set up a basic instance of pwndrop on your machine. Port 8000 has been connected to port 80 on the container, and port 8443 to port 443 on the container. So, in order to access the web server, you will need to open the URL `http://localhost:8000/` in order to access the installation screen. Also, create an empty directory so you can bind-mount it to `pwndrop`. 

All your data will be saved in this directory. So if you need to terminate the instance and restart it, you can do so without any loss of data. You can just stop the container, which will leave your volume untouched. Later, you can run another instance of `pwndrop` and bind-mount the same volume in order to continue from where you left off. 

Also, in order to access the login page, you will need to navigate to a specific 'secret' path. By default, this path is `/pwndrop`. If you do not navigate to this path, you will receive either a 404 error message or will be redirected to a site that can be configured in the `pwndrop.ini` file. So, the URL to be opened is `http://localhost:8000/pwndrop`.



## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yaml`/`docker-compose.yaml` for Pwndrop:

```yaml
version: "3.4"
services:
  pwndrop:
    image: harshavardhanj/pwndrop:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
      - "8443:443"
    volumes:
    	- "/path/to/host/dir:/pwndrop/data"
```

[![Try in ‘Play With Docker’](https://github.com/play-with-docker/stacks/raw/cff22438cb4195ace27f9b15784bbb497047afa7/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarshaVardhanJ/docker_files/master/pwndrop/docker-compose.yaml)



**NOTE: The above Play With Docker link does not work as PWD uses port 80 and 443. These ports are required to be free by `pwndrop`. Therefore, this will not work on Play With Docker.**

The above YAML file should be sufficient to set up a basic instance of Pwndrop. For more information, visit the [official Pwndrop documentation page](https://github.com/kgretzky/pwndrop).
