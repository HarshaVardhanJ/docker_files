# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

* [`latest`, `1.0.0`, `stable`](https://github.com/HarshaVardhanJ/docker_files/blob/master/pwndrop/Dockerfile)

### NOTE:

Apart from the aforementioned images, there are other images that contain `untested` as part of their tag. **Do not use these images.** As the tag suggests, they are present for purposes of testing. In order to test the images with `container-structure-test` and `trivy`, the image needs to be present in a public repository. Therefore, I first build and push the images with an `untested` tag. Then, I run tests on these images. When the image passes all tests, it is built again and pushed with the appropriate tags.

# Software Packages Installed

The container image contains the following software packages installed as a dependency for `pwndrop`, apart from the `pwndrop` binary itself  

* `openrc`

which is used for installing `pwndrop` as a service/daemon. Apart from this, no other packages are installed.



# Supported Architectures

Given below is a list of architectures for which Gitea has been built. In the near future, more architectures will be added.

* `amd64`
* `arm64`
* `arm32v6`
* `ppc64le`
* `s390x`
* `i386`



# How to use this image

## Start a `pwndrop` instance


A basic instance can be set up with the following one-liner command

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name pwndrop -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v /full/path/to/host/dir:/usr/local/pwndrop/data harshavardhanj/pwndrop:stable
```

This will set up a basic instance of pwndrop on your machine. Port 8000 has been connected to port 80 on the container, and port 8443 to port 443 on the container. So, in order to access the web server, you will need to open the URL `http://localhost:8000/` in order to access the installation screen. Also, create an empty directory so you can bind-mount it to `pwndrop`. 

All your data will be saved in this directory. So if you need to terminate the instance and restart it, you can do so without any loss of data. You can just stop the container, which will leave your volume untouched. Later, you can run another instance of `pwndrop` and bind-mount the same volume in order to continue from where you left off. 

Also, in order to access the login page, you will need to navigate to a specific 'secret' path. By default, this path is `/pwndrop`. If you do not navigate to this path, you will receive either a 404 error message or will be redirected to a site that can be configured in the `pwndrop.ini` file. So, the URL to be opened is `http://localhost:8000/pwndrop`.



## ... via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yaml`/`docker-compose.yaml` for Gitea:

```yaml
version: "3.4"
services:
  pwndrop:
    image: harshavardhanj/pwndrop:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
      - "8443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./pwndrop-data:/usr/local/pwndrop/data
      - ./pwndrop.ini:/usr/local/pwndrop/pwndrop.ini
```

[![Try in ‘Play With Docker’](https://github.com/play-with-docker/stacks/raw/cff22438cb4195ace27f9b15784bbb497047afa7/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarshaVardhanJ/docker_files/master/pwndrop/docker-compose.yaml)

**NOTE: The above Play With Docker example does not work. This has something to do with not being able to create volumes on the host.**

The above YAML file should be sufficient to set up a basic instance of Gitea. For more information, visit the [official Pwndrop documentation page](https://github.com/kgretzky/pwndrop).
