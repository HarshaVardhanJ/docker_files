# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

- [`3.9.1`, `latest`(*ddclient/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/HarshaVardhanJ/docker_files/blob/master/ddclient/v3.9.1/Dockerfile)

- [`3.9.0`, `stable`(*ddclient/Dockerfile*)](https://github.com/HarshaVardhanJ/docker_files/blob/master/ddclient/v3.9.0/Dockerfile)

  

### NOTE:

Apart from the aforementioned images, there are other images that contain `untested` as part of their tag. **Do not use these images.** As the tag suggests, they are present for purposes of testing. In order to test the images with `container-structure-test` and `trivy`, the image needs to be present in a public repository. Therefore, I first build and push the images with an `untested` tag. Then, I run tests on these images. When the image passes all tests, it is built again and pushed with the appropriate tags.

There are images with four tags currently - `latest`, `3.9.1`, `stable` , and `3.9.0`. All images are built on top of the `alpine` base image. Currently, the `latest` and `3.9.1` tag point to the same image. The `stable` and `3.9.0` tag point to the same image.

# Description of Tags

## `latest`, `3.9.1` ![Docker Image Version(tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/harshavardhanj/ddclient/3.9.1) ![Docker Image Version(tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/harshavardhanj/ddclient/latest)

The image with this tag contains no software packages installed except for the `ddclient` executable and its dependencies. To use this image,  use  the `latest` tag, or no tag at all as follows

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name ddclient \
-v /path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf \
harshavardhanj/ddclient:latest
```

or

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name ddclient \
-v /path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf \
harshavardhanj/ddclient
```



## `stable`, `3.9.0` ![Docker Image Version(tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/harshavardhanj/ddclient/3.9.0) ![Docker Image Version(tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/harshavardhanj/ddclient/stable)

Just like the `latest` image, this image contains only `ddclient` and its dependencies installed. To use this image, use the `stable` tag, or the `3.9.0` tag as follows

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name ddclient \
-v /path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf \
harshavardhanj/ddclient:stable
```

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name ddclient \
-v /path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf \
harshavardhanj/ddclient:3.9.0
```





# How to use this image

## Start a `ddclient` instance

```shell
$ docker container run -d --name ddclient \
-v /path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf \
harshavardhanj/ddclient
```

Running the above command will start a `ddclient` instance and will follow the dfirectives given in the configuration file(`/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf`) which has to be bind-mounted to the container.



## … via [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `stack.yaml`/`docker-compose.yaml` for `ddclient`:



```yaml
version: "3.4"
services:
	endlessh:
		image: harshavardhanj/ddclient:latest
		volumes:
			- "/path/to/config/file:/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf:ro"
		restart: always
```

After opening the above *Play With Docker* link, you should see a terminal.

To use in a swarm, run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yaml harshavardhanj/ddclient` from the manager node in your swarm, and wait for it initialise completely. To use on a local development machine, use `docker-compose -f stack.yaml up` from your local machine, and wait for it initialise completely. 



# Image Variants



## `ddclient:latest`, `ddclient:stable`, `ddclient`

These images are based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official
image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as`git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images.
