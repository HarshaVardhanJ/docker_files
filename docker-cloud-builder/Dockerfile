# This Dockerfile does the following:                               #
#                                                                   #
#    1. Imports the latest base image of Alpine Linux.              #
#    2. Adds the Community repository which contains Docker.        #
#    3. Upgrades all existing packages to their latest version.     #
#    5. Downloads a specific version of Docker and sets a flag to   #
#       enable experimental features(buildx) in Docker.             #
#    6. Downloads a specific version of the 'buildx' binary from    #
#       GitHub, extracts it, moves it to a directory in $PATH,      #
#       and sets the execute bit on it.                             #
#    7. Creates a user 'docker' who is part of the 'docker' group.  #
#    8. Copies the 'entrypoint.sh' script to a directory in $PATH.  #
#    9. Runs the 'entrypoint.sh' script, which takes care of        #
#       setting up 'buildx'.                                        #
#                                                                   #
# Note : This file is meant to be on GCP Cloud Build to build       #
#        images with multiple-architecture support. If you wish to  #                        
#        run the image locally, you will need to bind mount the     #
#        socket on which the Docker daemon listens to the           #
#        container.                                                 #
#                                                                   #

`buildx` added. This way, images can be built for multiple architectures. The \
suggested way to use this image is with GCP Cloud Build via a `cloudbuild.yaml` \
file in which this image will need to be invoked as a Cloud Builder. The \
arguments to the Cloud Builder will the same as the argument to the `buildx` \
executable. Start the arguments with 'build -f [DOCKERFILE] [BUILD-CONTEXT]. \
Check the sample `cloudbuild.yaml` file in this directory for an example of \
how this image is to be used in a `cloudbuild.yaml` file." \
