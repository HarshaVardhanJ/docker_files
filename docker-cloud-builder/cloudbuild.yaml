  # Run the 'getCredentials.sh' script within the gcloud builder.

  # from the Secrets Manager by using the gcloud command, and saves them 
  # to individual files.

  # Pull buildx image from Docker Hub and build 'buildx' image with multi-arch support
  ### NOTE:
  ###     In the build step below, the `docker-buildx:non-root` image is used to build
  ###     the `docker-buildx:non-root` image with multi-arch support. Therefore, since
  ###     there is a cyclical dependency, before running this in Cloud Build, a working
  ###     version of the `docker-buildx:non-root` image will need to be present in the
  ###     container registry(Docker Hub, in this case). The image will need to be built
  ###     either locally or elsewhere and pushed to the registry before the below step
  ###     can be run.
  ###
  ###     Since the 'buildx' binary is being run as a non-root user, the credentials for
  ###     authorising with Docker Hub will need to be passed to 'buildx' in the form of
  ###     secrets as shown in the step below. The User ID and Access Token(do not use a
  ###     password. This is exactly what access tokens are meant for) will need to be
  ###     present in the 'workspace' directory, which is directly mounted by Cloud Build.
  ###     Even though the authorisation secrets are being passed to buildx directly, step
  ###     (step number 2) is needed when pushing images using buildx.
