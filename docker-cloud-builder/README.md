## What is `docker-buildx`?

`docker-buildx` is a container image built on top of [Alpine Linux]() and has [Docker]() installed with [buildx]() support added. `buildx` is a Docker CLI plugin for extended build capabilities with BuildKit. `buildx` also has the ability to build for multiple architectures when supplied with the same Dockerfile. For more information on the features of `buildx`, click [this link](https://github.com/docker/buildx).

  

## How to use this image

### Building multi-arch images using `docker-buildx`

The easiest way to begin building images with the `docker-buildx` image is to use Google Cloud Platform’s Cloud Build. This is a tool builder to invoke `docker buildx` commands. Arguments passed to this builder will be passed to `docker buildx` directly, allowing callers to run [any `docker buildx` commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx/).

As of the moment of writing this README, there are no “official” images that serve this specific purpose, which is to help build images for multiple architectures by leveraging the `buildx` command in Docker. An example `cloudbuild.yaml` file is given below which is to be used with Cloud Build on Google Cloud Platform for automating builds.



```yaml
# Sample cloudbuild.yaml file
steps:
	- name: 'harshavardhanj/docker-buildx:latest'
		args: ['build', '-t', '[IMAGE_NAME:IMAGE_TAG]', '-f', '/path/to/Dockerfile', '.']
```



### Examples

The following examples demonstrate build requests that use this builder:



#### Build and push a container image to Google Container Registry

This `cloudbuild.yaml` simply invokes `docker buildx` and pushes the resulting image to GCR.

```yaml
steps:
	- name: 'harshavardhanj/docker-buildx:latest'
		args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/image_name', '.']
images: ['gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/image_name']
```

As far as the functionality of`buildx` is concerned, it is primarily useful for building images with multi-architecture support with no additional changes to the `Dockerfile`.



#### Build and push a container image to Docker Hub

##### Using GCP Secrets Manager

Common to both methods, it is recommended to create *access tokens* on Docker Hub. This way, your account password will not be exposed, and you can *create* and *revoke* access tokens any time you wish. 

Then, you will need to enable the Secrets Manager API on GCP. The steps to set up Secrets Manager can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/quickstart). Once the API has been enabled, create two new secrets : one for the Docker Hub username, and other for the Docker Hub Access Token.

Once you’ve created the secrets, grant the Cloud Build service account access to those two secrets. Refer to [this page](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/securing-builds/use-encrypted-secrets-credentials#grant_the_service_account_access_to_the_cryptokey) for instructions on how to grant access to the service account. That link provides instructions on how to grant access to CryptoKey, but the steps are similar for Secrets Manager. Once permission has been granted to Cloud Build, the `cloudbuild.yaml` file and other files required by it can be created.

Given below is a simpler version of the `cloudbuild.yaml` file that I use for building images on Cloud Build and pushing the built images to Docker Hub.

```yaml
steps:
  # Get the Docker Hub user ID and access token and save each of them to files
  # accessible to the succeeding steps
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    entrypoint: "bash"
    args: ["./docker-cloud-builder/getCredentials.sh"]

  # Log in to Docker Hub using the credentials obtained in the previous steps
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    entrypoint: "bash"
    args: ["-c", "docker login --username=$(cat ./UserID) --password=$(cat ./AccessToken)"]

  # Pull buildx image from Docker Hub and build 'buildx' image with multi-arch support
  - name: 'harshavardhanj/docker-buildx:latest'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - 'harshavardhanj/docker-buildx:latest'
      - '--platform'
      - 'linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/386,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm/v6'
      - '-f'
      - './docker-cloud-builder/Dockerfile'
      - '--push'
      - './docker-cloud-builder/.'
```



The `getCredentials.sh` script file :

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
#
#: Title        : getCredentials.sh
#: Date         : 17-Feb-2020
#: Author       : "Harsha Vardhan J" <vardhanharshaj@gmail.com>
#: Version      : 0.1
#: Description  : Script which is used to get credentials by
#                 Cloud Build in order to log in to Docker Hub.
#: Options      : None
#: Usage        : This script is to be used in GCP Cloud Build.
################


# Wrapper function around the gcloud command used to access secrets
getCreds() {

	# If two arguments are provided to the script and
	# if the second argument is not an empty string
  if [[ $# -eq 2 && -n ${2} ]] ; then
  	# 'gcloud' command used to access secrets
    gcloud beta secrets versions access ${1} --secret="${2}"
  else
    exit 1
  fi

}

# Calling the 'getCreds' function and providing the version
# of the secret and secret name
getCreds 1 DockerHubUserID > ./UserID
getCreds 1 DockerHubAccessToken > ./AccessToken

# End of script
```

The only things that you will need to change are the image tags and the paths to the Dockerfile given in the final step of the `cloudbuild.yaml` file. A fairly generic `cloudbuild.yaml` file is given below which can be used as a template in order to build multi-architecture images. The first two steps remain the same as they deal with

1. Obtaining the login credentials to Docker Hub.
2. Logging in to Docker Hub using credentials obtained in the previous step.

Depending on where you place the `getCredentials.sh` file in your repository, you may need to modify the `args:` value in the first step. The third step will be the one that will need to be modified as per your needs.

```yaml
steps:
  # Get the Docker Hub user ID and access token and save each of them to files
  # accessible to the succeeding steps
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    entrypoint: "bash"
    args: ["./path/to/getCredentials.sh/from/repo/root"]

  # Log in to Docker Hub using the credentials obtained in the previous steps
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    entrypoint: "bash"
    args: ["-c", "docker login --username=$(cat ./UserID) --password=$(cat ./AccessToken)"]

  # Pull buildx image from Docker Hub and build with multi-arch support
  - name: 'harshavardhanj/docker-buildx:latest'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - '[dockerHubUsername]/[imageName]:[imageTag]'
      - '-t'
      - '[dockerHubUsername]/[imageName]:[extraImageTag]'
      - '--platform'
      - 'linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/s390x,linux/386,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm/v6'
      - '-f'
      - './path/to/Dockerfile/from/repo/root'
      - '--push'
      - './path/to/Dockerfile/directory/.'
```

The arguments to the `--platform` flag can be changed if needed. At times, building for `s390x` or `386` platform results in error for some images. If you encounter any such errors, which will be visible in the build logs, remove the offending architecture in which the error was encountered and build the image.

Now, using this setup multiple triggers can be created on Cloud Build to build and push multi-architecture images to Docker Hub and/or GCR.

##### Using GCP Key-Management Service(KMS)

This requires a few more steps in order to authenticate with Docker Hub. The steps for this is taken from [GCP’s Cloud Build documentation](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/interacting-with-dockerhub-images#pushing_images_to_docker_hub). For more detailed information, navigate to the given link. 

The first stage consists of encrypting your Docker Hub credentials so it can be passed to Cloud Build in a secure manner. As I am not using this method, I will not elaborate on it. In the link given above, you will find all the steps necessary to store and use credentials using GCP's KMS.

##### NOTE

Storing and accessing secrets in Secrets Manager(and Key Management Service) incurs a charge. While this charge is quite low, it is important to note that it is not free. Therefore, if you go by the strategy suggested in this README, you will be using either Secrets Manager or KMS in order to store and access credentials needed to login to your container registry. This will result in a charge being levied for storage and access of secrets.

#### Additional options in `cloudbuild.yaml`

#### `timeout`

Builds in Cloud Build are terminated after 10 minutes, by default. To override this, specify the `timeout` option in your `cloudbuild.yaml` file like so:

```yaml
steps:
	- name: ...
	
	- name: ...
	
timeout: "1200s"
```

The value for `timeout` should always be specified in seconds. In the above example, the timeout value is `1200s` which is 20 minutes. If your builds take longer than 10 minutes to complete, use the `timeout` option. In my case, building an `nginx` image in which `openssl` is compiled from source, it takes quite a bit of time(upwards of 1.5 hours in Cloud Build). Therefore, I prefer to specify a high `timeout` value, and I use the `machineType` option which is described below.



#### `machineType`

Cloud Build has an option to build using a more powerful CPU by specifying the `machineType` option under `options` in your `cloudbuild.yaml` file. For example,

```yaml
steps:
	- name: ...
	
	- name: ...
	
options:
	machineType: 'N1_HIGHCPU_8'
```

The two `machineTypes` that are offered are

* `N1_HIGHCPU_8` (provides 8 CPU cores for the build)
* `N1_HIGHCPU_32`(provides 32 CPU cores for the build)

While the speed of the build is considerably faster, the build may take longer to start due to the time taken to provision the underlying resources for the build. At times, the build may get cancelled if the resources are not available.

While it might be tempting to mention a more powerful CPU using `machineType` for all builds in order to speed it up, being conservative with the usage of this option would be prudent. Builds with the `machineType` option specified aren’t free unlike the builds where this option is not specified. So do keep in mind that you will be billed for usage of either `N1_HIGHCPU_8` or `N1_HIGHCPU_32`.  For more information, please peruse the documentation for Cloud Build provided by GCP.



## Image Variants

The `docker-buildx` image comes in the following variants/tags, each of which are described below:



### `docker-buildx:stable`

This image is also referred to with the following tags:

* `latest`
* `19.03.5-r0`
* `19.03.5`
* `19.03`

As the name of the tag suggests, this image is well-tested is recommended for usage. Version pinning of the image refers to the version of Docker installed in the image.



### `docker-buildx:testing`

Any and all new features or changes will be first introduced in this image before it is tested and incorporated into the `stable` image. At times, this image will be the same as the `stable` image. Regardless, it is not advisable to use this unless you don’t mind abrupt changes introduced to the image.



### `docker-buildx:non-root`

This image runs the `buildx` executable as a non-root user(`docker`, currently, is the name of the user). The absence of the `stable` tag does not in any way indicate an unstable or untested image. This image is just as stable as the image with the  `stable` tag.

As the image with the `stable` tag runs the `buildx` command as `root` user, for people who do not wish to run a container that runs processes as root, this image provides the same functionality as the `stable` image but with the added benefit(?) of running as non-root user within the container. For more information on how to go about using this image, refer to the beginning of this document which points to the Dockerfile page on GitHub for each of the image tags.



### `docker-buildx:untested`

**This image is NOT meant for public use**. It exists purely for purposes of testing the image. Using this image will most certainly result in some failure/error. The container may not even start to begin with.



## License

Currently, no specific license has been applied to the software in the image’s repository.

As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).

As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant licenses for all software contained within.
