  # Pull `buildx:testing` image from Docker Hub and build 'binfmt' image with multi-arch support
  ### NOTE:
  ###     In the build step below, the `docker-buildx:testing` image is used to build
  ###     the `binfmt:testing` image with multi-arch support. Therefore, since
  ###     there is a cyclical dependency because the `docker-buildx:testing` image uses
  ###     the `binfmt:testing` image, before running this in Cloud Build, a working
  ###     version of the `docker-buildx:testing`, and of `binfmt:testing` image will need 
  ###     to be present in the container registry(Docker Hub, in this case). The image will
  ###     need to be built either locally or elsewhere and pushed to the registry before the 
  ###     below step can be run.
